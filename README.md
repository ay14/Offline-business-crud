# 🗃️ RxDB Offline-First React App with MongoDB Atlas Sync

This project is a **React.js offline-first CRUD application** using **RxDB** for client-side data persistence and synchronization. It syncs local data with **MongoDB Atlas** via a custom **Node.js (Express) backend**.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16
- npm >= 7
- MongoDB Atlas account and connection string

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rxdb-mongodb-sync.git
cd rxdb-mongodb-sync
🖥️ Setup: Client (React + RxDB)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd client
npm install
npm start
This will start your development server at http://localhost:3000.

🌐 Setup: Server (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)
Step 1: Configure MongoDB Atlas
In server/index.js, replace the connection string:

js
Copy
Edit
const uri = 'mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname?...';
Step 2: Install Dependencies and Start Server
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../server
npm install
node index.js
This runs the backend server on http://localhost:4000.

🔄 How Replication Works
RxDB collections use replicateRxCollection() for real-time sync.

Pull: POST /sync/pull → server fetches and returns new documents.

Push: POST /sync/push → client sends changed documents to the server.

Backend uses updatedAt timestamps and checkpoints for syncing.

📡 Offline-First Support
Data is stored in the browser via IndexedDB using the dexie adapter.

Works fully offline.

Automatically syncs when the connection is restored.

🧪 Testing
Start the backend (node index.js)

Start the frontend (npm start)

Open http://localhost:3000

Create/update/delete records

Disconnect and reconnect internet — observe auto sync

🛡️ Security Notes
Never commit your MongoDB connection string to public repos.

In production, protect your backend with proper auth (JWT, OAuth, etc.)

no need for the nodejs and express js as it is in react js only

Here’s a simplified README section tailored for your React-only RxDB project that works offline and syncs with MongoDB Atlas:

📦 Offline-First React App with RxDB and MongoDB Sync
This project is an offline-first React.js CRUD application that uses RxDB for local storage and synchronization. It automatically syncs with MongoDB Atlas when the network is available—no backend or Express.js server required.

🚀 Features
🗃️ Local database powered by RxDB

🌐 Automatic sync with MongoDB Atlas

🔌 Works offline and syncs data when online

💡 Built entirely with React.js

🛠️ Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rxdb-react-mongodb-sync.git
cd rxdb-react-mongodb-sync
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Configure MongoDB Atlas

Replace the placeholder in your connection string (e.g., mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@...) inside the project where replication is defined.

Make sure you’ve allowed access to your IP in MongoDB Atlas.

Start the Development Server

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
🧪 How It Works
Data is stored in IndexedDB using RxDB.

RxDB replicates data with MongoDB Atlas using CouchDB-style replication or a bridge (requires serverless sync solution).

No Node.js/Express backend is involved—sync is configured entirely on the frontend.

MongoDB Atlas# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
